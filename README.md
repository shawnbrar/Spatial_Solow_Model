# Human Capital, Technological Know-How, Geographical Proximity and Trade in Economic Growth
## A spatial econometrics approach

In this study we desire to contribute to the topic of economic growth while taking into account the spatial spillovers. We do this by estimating a spatial panel data model with time varying spatial weights to estimate the further augmented Solow model by Nonneman & Vanhoudt. This study differs from the existing body of literature, since, we estimate the Solow model in a spatial-panel setting and also see the effects of two new additional variables - human capital and technological know-how.
